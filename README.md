I have been using Home Assistant for about 8 months now and wanted to share my configuration to date. Included components/items are:
1) NodeMCU (by BruhAutomation)
2) Combined nmap & gps logger
3) ZoneMinder
4) Floorplan (by pkozul)
5) Wink
6) Echo
7) Sensi/Emerson thermostat
8) Alerts
9) Zwave toggled garage remote
10) HA Alarm with flashing lights, siren and notify
11) Door sensors
12) Aeotec Z-Wave Gen5 Multi-Sensor
13) Glances
14) FireTv (recently stopped working)
15) Kodi

I plan to add Google Home, Magic Mirror, zwave door locks, and possibly Octoprint.
